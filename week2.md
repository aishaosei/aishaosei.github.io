During the first week of the program, our primary focus was on acquainting ourselves with the program's overarching goals and expectations. It was an engaging time as we had the opportunity to connect with our mentors and fellow group members, forging relationships that would be essential for collaboration throughout the program. We also began discussing our research plans, exploring various ideas and avenues for exploration. Additionally, we participated in a Python workshop, which equipped us with valuable programming skills that would prove invaluable in our research endeavors. However, I encountered a brief setback as I was unexpectedly out of work on Thursday and Friday. Despite this, I am committed to catching up on missed tasks and contributing to our group's projects, including the website-making project that my group members briefed me on. Overall, the first week laid a solid foundation for our journey ahead, and I am eager to continue learning and contributing to our collective goals.
