This week, although I was unable to attend the NSA Talk, our team managed to successfully finalize our presentation, which was a significant milestone. We are now dedicating our efforts to completing our final report, which is approaching its deadline. The report is taking shape, and weâ€™re working diligently to ensure it meets all requirements and is submitted on time. In addition to these tasks, I am thrilled to announce that I have completed my GitHub website. It is now fully updated with detailed information on all of my recent projects and contributions. I am eager to showcase my work through this platform and plan to continue adding new projects and updates as I progress. If you have any questions or need further information about any of these updates, please feel free to reach out!
