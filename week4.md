Today, I met my high school teacher, Mrs. Elaine Ross, which was a pleasant surprise. My Juneteenth didnt good as planned, but this was a break to reflect on its significance.I attended the NASA trip on Thursday,and i loved it. I got to learn alot more details on NASA and their ways into knowing the climate and the air we breathe in. With the Mid-Summer Research Symposium just two weeks away, there's a lot to prepare for, but I'm excited about the opportunity to present my work.
