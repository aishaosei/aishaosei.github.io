This week, we made significant strides in preparing for our final symposium presentation. We gathered in the lab to brainstorm and outline the key points, refining our slides to ensure clarity and engagement. Each team member contributed to creating an elevator pitch video, where we practiced and filmed our individual segments to confidently share our project's insights. Additionally, we carefully reviewed both the Word document and LaTeX templates provided for our final research report. After discussing the pros and cons of each, we made an informed decision on the best format to showcase our work professionally. Overall, it was a busy and productive week, filled with collaborative efforts and important decisions, and we are confident that our preparation and hard work will pay off in our final presentation.
