This week was a momentous conclusion to my time at the 2024 CEAMLS Summer AI Research Institute, and I couldn't be more excited about how it all unfolded. On Tuesday, we had the opportunity to present our final projects in a detailed 20-minute presentation, followed by a 5-minute Q&A session where we engaged with our audience's questions and feedback. Preparing for this presentation involved countless hours of collaboration, revision, and rehearsal, and it was incredibly gratifying to finally share the results of our hard work with everyone. In addition to the presentations, I spent a considerable amount of time in the lab finalizing all our reports and papers. This involved meticulous attention to detail, ensuring that every aspect of our research was accurately documented and well-presented. I wanted to make sure that our findings were not only comprehensive but also polished to the highest standard before submission. As the week drew to a close, I also completed the institute's post-survey. This provided a reflective opportunity to evaluate my experience, offer feedback on the program, and think about the skills and knowledge gained over the summer. Wrapping up all these tasks and reflecting on the overall journey was both rewarding and a bit bittersweet. The institute has been an incredible experience, and I'm proud of the progress we've made and the learning we've achieved.
