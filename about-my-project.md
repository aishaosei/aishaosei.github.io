## About My Project

AI-Based Cyberattack Identification System

The project involves building an AI model to detect, identify, and classify cyberattack types, addressing challenges such as large-scale connected systems and unconventional malware. Tasks include data collection, preprocessing, machine learning model development, classifier implementation, and performance analysis. Me and my team will follow a structured schedule, culminating in final presentations at the End of Summer Research Symposium.
