This week was relatively slow, though we spent a significant amount of time in the labs working on our project. Each day, we focused on different aspects of the project, ensuring we were making steady progress. Dr. Pandey visited the lab mid-week and gave us a literature assignment related to our research, which added another layer to our workload. On Thursday, we had an exciting break from our routine when a group of high school students visited the lab. My team member Kennedi took the lead, presenting an overview of our project and giving a short demonstration to the students. They seemed very engaged and asked several thoughtful questions, which made the experience rewarding for all of us. It was a busy week, but the interactions and additional tasks provided a nice change of pace from our usual lab work.
