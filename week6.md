This has been the week of presentations! My group and I dedicated a significant amount of time and effort preparing for our upcoming Mid-Summer Symposium. We meticulously went over our project details, ensuring that our presentation would be clear, engaging, and informative. We practiced our delivery, worked on perfecting our slides, and even anticipated potential questions from the audience to make sure we were fully prepared. Our excitement and nerves were building up as the day of the symposium approached. However, much to our surprise, it ended up being postponed. While we were initially disappointed by the delay, we decided to use this extra time to further refine our presentation. We plan to take advantage of the additional time to gather more data, polish our visuals, and rehearse even more thoroughly so that we can deliver an exceptional presentation when the symposium is finally rescheduled. This week has been a whirlwind of activity and emotions, but we're staying positive and looking forward to showcasing our hard work in the near future.
