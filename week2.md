In week 2, our group research efforts intensified with guidance from mentors Chongkon and Clinton Cole. We began with a writing workshop led by Professor Anita, emphasizing the importance of clear communication in research. Clinton Cole then outlined a structured approach to our project, dissecting our information into five key parts: data, processing features, machine learning model, classifier, and control. Throughout the week, we meticulously analyzed research papers and synthesized key insights, laying a solid foundation for our project. This immersive experience fostered greater cohesion and collaboration within our group.
