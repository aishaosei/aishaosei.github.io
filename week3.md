---During the third week, we started with the Monday writing workshops. In this workshop, I learned valuable writing organizational tips and gained more insight into academic language. On Wednesday, we had a special guest speaker from Howard University, Mrs. Gloria Washington. I thoroughly enjoyed her presentation and talk, which focused on African American English (AAE) and other African American languages. She highlighted how voice assistants are typically trained to speak one dialect, Standard American English, despite the diverse ways people speak across different states. My team and I have been working diligently in our labs, currently searching for a cyberattack to study and deciding which machine learning tool to utilize. On Thursday, we went on a field trip to Johns Hopkins APL, where we were given a tour of the Intelligent Systems Center labs. One highlight for me was the robotics dogâ€”it was incredibly cool.
